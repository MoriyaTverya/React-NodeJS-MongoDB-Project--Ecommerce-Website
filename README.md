# Project Overview**<br>
This platform serves business clients of a wholesale supplier. The supplier provides goods to clients who order in wholesale quantities, and these wholesale clients then sell the goods to private customers. The platform is designed to facilitate large-scale and varied orders for different product types and sizes.

**Features**<br>
**Easy and Simple Wholesale Ordering:** The platform enables users to place wholesale orders efficiently.<br>
**User Registration:** User registration is managed exclusively by the supplier. Self-registration is not available.<br>
**Order Management:** Clients can add the required quantities to their cart, and inventory is updated accordingly when an order is placed.<br>
**Repeat Orders:** Clients can easily repeat a previous order.<br>
**Order Processing:** Orders are sent to the supplier and appear in their management area. The supplier processes the order, prepares it for shipment, and sends it to the client.<br>
**Direct Payment Arrangement:** Payment is settled directly between the client and the supplier.<br>
**Rating System:** The platform ranks clients and products based on orders.<br>
**Personal Area for Users:** Each user has a personal area to view their order history, data, and ratings of previous orders.<br>
